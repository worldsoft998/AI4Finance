AIStockPredictBbMain, Stock Market Price Prediction Based on AI Technologies

  
AIStockPredictBbMain is a Python library that uses several AI prediction models to predict stocks returns over a defined period of time. 

AIStockPredictBbMain is based on AI /  deep neural networks algorithms from darts to process time series of stock data.

Darts is a Python library for easy manipulation and forecasting of time series. It contains a variety of models, from classics such as ARIMA to deep neural networks. The models can all be used in the same way, using fit() and predict() functions, similar to scikit-learn. The library also makes it easy to backtest models, and combine the predictions of several models and external regressors. Darts supports both univariate and multivariate time series and models, and the neural networks can be trained on multiple time series.
